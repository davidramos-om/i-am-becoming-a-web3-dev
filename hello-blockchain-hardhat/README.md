# Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat compile (generates artifacts, cache, and typechain-types)
```

### Start a new project
```
npx hardhat (empty basic project js or ts)
```

### using Hardhat Network
```
npx hardhat run --network hardhat scripts/deploy.ts
```

### running stand-alone node
```
npx hardhat node
```
